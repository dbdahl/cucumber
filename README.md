# Cucumber Package

This package purpose is to make using the transform slice sampler as easy as possible for users. It also includes files and code used to run simulation studies to determine in which situations the transform slice sampler performs well and when it does not. 

This repository has two parts found in two different directories. The **cucumber** directory has the code needed to run each slice sampler (GESS, Latent, Stepping Out, Transform). The **samCode** directory has all the code to run the simulations used to compare each of the sampling methods. 

The **samCode** directory contains sub-directories for the G prior simulation study and each of the standard targets that were tested, standard normal, gamma, and inverse gamma. Each sub-directory has README files that explain each script.
